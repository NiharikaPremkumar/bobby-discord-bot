# Basic Discord Server Bot

## Overview

This project is a basic Discord server bot that responds to predefined messages with specific responses. It is designed to automate simple interactions and provide instant answers to frequently asked questions or common statements within a Discord server.

## Features

- **Predefined Responses**: The bot replies with predefined responses when it detects specific keywords or phrases in the server chat.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and easy to customize responses.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, ensuring smooth performance even in larger servers.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-server-bot.git
   cd discord-server-bot
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the bot**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your bot token:
     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
     ```

4. **Define responses**:
   - Edit `responses.py` to include your predefined responses. For example:
     ```python
     responses = {
         "hello": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
         "help": "Here are the commands you can use: ..."
     }
     ```

5. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Structure

- **`main.py`**: The main script to run the bot. It initializes the bot and listens for messages.
- **`responses.py`**: Contains the predefined responses in a dictionary format.
- **`.env`**: Stores the bot token securely.

## Future Scope

While this bot currently handles predefined responses effectively, there are several enhancements that can be implemented to make it more robust and versatile:

1. **Dynamic Responses**: Integrate machine learning or natural language processing to provide more dynamic and context-aware responses.
2. **Command Handling**: Expand functionality to include command handling, enabling users to execute various commands for different functionalities.
3. **Database Integration**: Store user interactions and preferences in a database for personalized responses and improved interaction tracking.
4. **Moderation Features**: Add capabilities to help with server moderation, such as auto-muting, kicking, or banning users based on predefined rules.
5. **Customizable Prefixes**: Allow server administrators to set custom prefixes for commands, making the bot more adaptable to different server environments.
